## Introduction

This Privacy Policy is meant to help the _User_ understand the information that the _Application_ collects, why it collects, and how that information is used.


## Information Collection and Use

The _Application_ only stores information pertaining to alarms, _User_ preferences, or data meant to enhance the _User_ experience.

This information is stored locally, only visible to the _Application_, and is never shared with anyone or any other app. (See **Security** for more information)

The _Application_ never accesses or saves Sensitive Personal Information.

If a _User_ chooses to store any _PSI_ in the _Application_, the _User_ is responsible for complying with any regulatory controls regarding that data.

The _Application_ does not use any third-party libraries that may collect _PSI_; however, this Privacy Policy cannot speak for the Android or Google libraries.


## Security

While the information that is stored should only be visible to the _Application_, it is possible that on a modified phone, such as one that has been rooted, this may not be the case. Consequently, the _Developer_ cannot guarantee the information's absolute security.


## Childrenâ€™s Privacy

This Privacy Policy does not address anyone under the age of 13. The _Application_ does not knowingly collect PSI from anyone, let alone children under 13.


## Changes to This Privacy Policy

The _Developer_ may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, as a result, the _User_ is advised to review this page periodically for any changes. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.
